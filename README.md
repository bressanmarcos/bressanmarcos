## It's me, Marcos! 👋

Welcome to my Github profile!

We both know that Github is also an awesome showcase for personal and professional projects, but unfortunately there is no way to group them together.
Therefore, I strongly recommend you to check out [my portfolio website](https://bressanmarcos.github.io) where I am trying to organize some of them.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my master's thesis! The idea is to develop an adapter for the [PADE](https://github.com/grei-ufc/pade) framework to make its agents able to interact with co-simulations in conformance with the Functional Mock-up Interface ([FMI Standard](https://fmi-standard.org)).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on the [Lightning Network daemon](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) project.
- 📫 How to reach me: Try my [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/bressanmarcos) or my Discord (bressan#7490).
