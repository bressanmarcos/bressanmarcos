## Hey, I’m Marcos! 👋

I'm a backend-focused software engineer with a strong DevOps mindset and a passion for infrastructure automation and scalable systems.

I work primarily with **Python**, **Go**, and **TypeScript**, and build infrastructure using **AWS**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Terraform**. I'm particularly comfortable with distributed systems, event-driven architectures, and CI/CD automation.

### ⚠️ A Note About Contributions

Don’t be fooled by my GitHub contributions graph — most of my professional work has been done in **Bitbucket**, **GitLab**, or **private GitHub organizations** under separate accounts. My GitHub activity doesn’t reflect the full picture of my development work.
